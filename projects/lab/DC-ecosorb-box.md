DC ecosorb filtering box
========================

PCB fabrication
---------------

Install the software for the milling machine from Bantam tools website, and
familiarize yourself with the machine through the tutorial videos.

Install the mounting guide and calibrate the machine.

Install the PCB board to engrave using the double sided tape.

Load the design (clear the bottom layer that does not exist in our case).

Engraving:
- Traces: engraving bit 0.005" using a custom depth of 0.4 (about 2h better
  done overnight because of the noise)
- Holes: 1/64" flat-end mill
- Outline: 1/16" flat end mill

Vacuum clean after each step to avoid inhaling the dust.

Once the board is milled, solder the connectors (DON'T use the same polarity
for both).


Box assembly
------------

Use the provided element and screws. Do not put the top and bottom cover of the
box.

The PCB should be mounted with the copper side against the 4 corner pieces.
