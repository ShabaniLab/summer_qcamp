DC ecosorb filtering box
========================

PCB fabrication
---------------

Install the software for the milling machine from Bantam tools website, and
familiarize yourself with the machine through the tutorial videos.

Install the mounting guide and calibrate the machine.

Install the PCB board to engrave using the double sided tape.

Load the design (clear the bottom layer that does not exist in our case).

Engraving:
- Traces: engraving bit 0.005" using a custom depth of 0.4 (about 2h better
  done overnight because of the noise)
- Holes: 1/64" flat-end mill
- Outline: 1/16" flat end mill

Vacuum clean after each step to avoid inhaling the dust.

Once the board is milled, solder the connectors (DON'T use the same polarity
for both).


Box assembly
------------

Use the provided element and screws. Do not put the top and bottom cover of the
box.

The PCB should be mounted with the copper side against the 4 corner pieces.


Ecosorb preparation
-------------------

The ECOSORB resin is an expoxy resin in two parts (X and Y). The instruction
sheet should be with the containers. You will need the scale located in the
bottom drawer by the MBE computer (ask Kasra or Kaushini). Since the resin is
not a nice chemical you should prepare it under the hood by the MBE. Be SURE to
protect the hood using aluminium foil. Also ask what glassware to use to
somebody from the lab.

The X component is not really fluid to start with but it gets better when it
gets warmer.

To avoid issues, you should pour the resin on only one side of the PCB at at
time and cure the box with this side up.

You must protect the hot plate on which you will prepare the resin and then
bake the box since some resin will leak out. Cure the box for about a night at
95ËšC.
