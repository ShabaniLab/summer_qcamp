Microwave optical table
=======================


Component positioning
---------------------

Figure out the best position for each component and the proper size for the
copper pieces to keep it in place (securing the mixers and power splitter is
the most important, securing the circulators would be best). Keep in mind that
the holes should not be too close to the edge (> 5mm).

Determine which piece require a bottom spacer (to allow connecting SMA cables
to it).

Cut the copper pieces, using the sacrificial wood piece to avoid bending it too
much. Drill the holes (be careful copper tend top stick to the tool).

Put everything together.


Testing
-------

Check the power requirement of each mixer on the manufacturer website, write
down the required power on the copper plate.

Use the power analyser to determine how much power to apply so that each mixer
is properly driven (you may need to add an attenuator on one branch when the
same signal is used to drive 2 mixers).

TODO complete with the use of Keysight AWG and digitizer.
