Sapphire filtering box design
=============================

The goal of this project is to reproduce the design of a filtering box with low
losses using a stripline on sapphire to cool down electrical signals.

The original design for that box can be found in
*Leonardo Di Carlo. Mesoscopic Electronics Beyond DC Transport. PhD thesis, Harvard University, 2007.*
(there is a paper of this thesis in the lab). The design is fairly simple but
we need a 3D model to get the pieces manufactured.

To design the pieces you can use Autodesk Inventor (ask Kasra) or Autodesk
Fusion 360 (ask Medhi). It is generally possible to get 3D models of the SMA
connectors from either the manufacturer website or a vendor.
